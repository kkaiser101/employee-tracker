# Employee Tracker

## Description

This project was created to gain experience and practice using MySQL. In this project, you will be able to use a command prompt application to view the departments, roles, and employees within the sample database. The ability to add new roles, departments, and employees is currently a WIP feature but will be added in a later update. 

## Installation

- 1) Make sure you have MySQL installed!

- 2) Make sure the schema is run and and it has been seeded.

- 3) Enter `npm i` in the command window

- 4) After all packages have been installed, enter `node server.js` to run the program
